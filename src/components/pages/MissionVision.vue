      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Bringing communities and organizations together to reduce youth
        suicide as we break the negative stigma associated with mental
        illness and asking for help; as we lift, build, and serve one another.</p>

      <h2>How this mission will be achieved</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Professional, inspirational speakers who have dealt with and
            overcome struggles will authentically share their stories with
            the student body in assemblies. Their purpose is to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Invite all youth to join Rising Up Together, either as a
              participant or a volunteer.</li>
            <li>Replace negative stigmas with hope, acceptance, and respect.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each month create and display posters with powerful,
            uplifting messages throughout the school that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reassure that their is no shame in asking for help.</li>
            <li>Create and build relationships of trust so participants
              will feel comfortable in asking for help.</li>
            <li>Remind students to lift, build, and serve each other.</li>
            <li>Invite further participation in Rising Up Together.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Youth will participate in weekly counselor-facilitated meetings
            after school to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Safely discuss mental illness in an environment that fosters
              optimism, hope, and support.</li>
            <li>Provide youth with ideal ways to connect with others who
              struggle, as they relate and form lifelong friendships.
              We do this carefully by matching students with those they
              trust according to their needs and the severity of their
              circumstances.</li>
            <li>Teach youth how to powerfully empathize and lift others
              around them who are also struggling.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Combine forces with other organizations and skilled,
            compassionate volunteers for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teach habits and skills to the youth that will help
              participants to thrive mentally, emotionally, socially,
              and physically throughout the rest of their lives,
              such as: mindfulness, meditation, yoga, service, creative arts,
              sports/physical activities, trust and recreation games, ropes
              course activities, vision boards, music therapy, nutrition
              and health, etc.</li>
            <li>Volunteers, who have dealt with similar challenges, will
              experience peace and healing as they lift the youth.</li>
            <li>Utilize the strengths of other like-minded organizations
              for the common purpose of lifting their communities out of
              this crisis.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
